## Introduction

The Razorpay PHP package makes the task of integrating the Razorpay payment gateway dead simple in your PHP project by providing an elegant & well tested wrapper around the Razorpay API making integration with PHP projects more neat & simple. We don't want to overwhelm you but just a few prerequisite sort of stuff we want you to know are as follows. They are really very few _promise!_ 

- API throws exceptions instead of returning errors
- Options are passed as an array instead of multiple arguments wherever possible
- All request and responses are communicated over JSON
- A minimum of PHP 5.3 is required

## Installation

- **Via Composer**

```
composer require razorpay/razorpay
```

- **Manually**

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/razorpay/razorpay-php/releases) and then include `Razorpay.php` in your application, after which you can use the API as usual.
